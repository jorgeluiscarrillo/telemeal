## Motivation
Often during peak hours, customers have to deal with the frustration of waiting in long, exhausting lines before being able to place their order at a restaurant. Telemeal is a modern replacement for the legacy Point-of-Sale (POS) system whose main goal is to shorten long order lines and to provide an intuitive way of managing a restaurant business.

This project was done as a software engineering project at California State University, Long Beach, for CECS 491A/491B.
Team: Jorge Carrillo, Bryan Duong, Phillips Huynh, and Daehee Kang.
